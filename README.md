## Installation

```bash
apm install atom-hack
```

## Usage

By default Atom-Hack assumes that HHVM is installed locally and needs zero-configuration if that's the case. But in case the server is remote, Please add this configuration to your `Project Root/.atom-hack`
```
{
  "type":"remote",
  "host":"Remote Host's Domain or IP",
  "username":"Your Username",
  "port":22,
  "privateKey":"Full Path to Private Key",
  "remoteDir":"Directory on the remote server without the last slash"
}
```
This plugin will validate all .hh, .php files and the files starting with <?hh or <?php
Note: Make sure to restart your Atom Editor after changing your configuration file.
Note: If you're using a remote server, this package will automatically upload your files to the remote Server
